                  <p>The health, safety and wellbeing of all our customers, team members & business partners is our main priority. Our stores will now be closed in line with COVID restrictions.
                        At this present moment in time House of Blues is still operating as normal, but due to the current circumstances please be aware that delivery times may vary.
            <br></br><p>Delivery Wherever possible, we’d really appreciate it if you could opt to have your order delivered to a safe place, and minimise contact with our courier partners. You’ll receive a calling card once your parcel is delivered. If delivering to your door, couriers will knock and wait at a safe distance to ensure your parcel is received. They’ll also take your name rather than asking for a signature.</p>
